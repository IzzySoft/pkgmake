History for pkgmake
===================

v0.1.2
-------------------
+ added the MKTAR configuration variable (and -notar command line switch)
+ added the NUKECVS config variable (and -nonukecvs command line switch)
  for cleaning up the copy of your source (and thus the distribution
  tarball) from CVS/SVN config files
! configuration files have been overriding command line options - fixed.
* removed all the automatic sudo - if you need to run as a different user,
  you now have to sudo the script yourself

v0.1.1 (20.07.2007)
-------------------
* first public version
