History for pkgmake
===================

v0.1.4
-------------------
+ the new -section cmd line switch (or SECTION config keyword) now causes
  pkgmake to create a separate .dspec file for debbuild, replacing the
  __GROUP__ variable by the given Debian section instead of the RPM group.
  By default, this .dspec file will be deleted after processing.
+ some documentation updates: "man pkgmake" now also lists some examples,
  and the doc/pkgmake.txt file finally has "additional information"

v0.1.3 (27.07.2007)
-------------------
+ add uninstall target to Makefile and make the whole Makefile better complying
  to what the make documentation recommends
! the -p command line parameter was setting the package name (and not the
  packager, as it should)
+ added MKSDEB and MKSRPM configuration options (and corresponding command line
  parameters -sdeb, -srpm, -nosdeb, -nosrpm) - source packages are no longer
  created by default (set MKSDEB=1 and MKSRPM=1 in the configuration file to
  restore previous behaviour)
* changed the "silencing" parameters: \"-q -q\" as before (turn off STDOUT and
  STDERR from sub-processes, i.e. debbuild/rpmbuild). But: -Q to make pkgmake
  itself silent. This way you can tell pkgmake to "shut up" while still having
  the output from debbuild/rpmbuild.
+ added the possibility to pass additional parameters to debbuild/rpmbuild
  (see the DEBOPTS/RPMOPTS config and -debopt/-rpmopt command line parameters)

v0.1.2 (22.07.2007)
-------------------
+ added the MKTAR configuration variable (and -notar command line switch)
+ added the NUKECVS config variable (and -nonukecvs command line switch)
  for cleaning up the copy of your source (and thus the distribution
  tarball) from CVS/SVN config files
! configuration files have been overriding command line options - fixed.
* removed all the automatic sudo - if you need to run as a different user,
  you now have to sudo the script yourself
+ Added processing for *.rpm packages (see the new configuration options
  MKDEB and MKRPM). You now can decide whether you want to build *.deb, *.rpm
  or both. Use command line parameters (-[no]deb, -[no]rpm) to override.
! Changelog was applied in wrong order (causing rpmbuild to fail)

v0.1.1 (20.07.2007)
-------------------
* first public version
