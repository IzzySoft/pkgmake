.TH "PKGMAKE.TPL" "5" "22 April 2008"
.SH "NAME" 
pkgmake.tpl \- Template files for \fBpkgmake\fR, which creates RPM spec
files and builds *.rpm/*.deb packages
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents the replacement variables which can be used in the
pkgmake template files. For a description of what pkgmake does, see the pkgmake(8)
manpage. For general issues e.g. on the syntax of SPEC files (which will be
generated from these templates), see the "SEE ALSO" section below.

.SH "SETTINGS" 
.PP 
All replacement variables have two leading and two trailing underscores.
Nothing else will be replaced in the files, and thus must apply to the syntax
of RPM SPEC files. The entire template file must produce a valid SPEC file
after replacements have been done.

For most of the variables (if not mentioned otherwise) applies: If there is no
replacement specified, they will be replaced by an empty string (i.e. the
variable will simply be removed, but the remaining line stays intact). This
may lead to invalid SPEC files in case of essential variables, so take care.

.PP
The following replacement variables are available in pkgmake template files: 

.IP "\fB__BUILDARCH__\fP" 10
Stands for the target architecture the package is intended for (i.e. i386,
athlon, noarch, etc.). Will be replaced by the configuration variable
$BUILDARCH, which can be overridden by the -a command line switch.
 
.IP "\fB__CONFIG__\fP" 10
With the -conf parameter, the user can specify a list of files to be treated as
configuration files. They will be placed here with a leading "%conf", e.g.

%conf /etc/sample.conf
 
.IP "\fB__DESCRIPTION__\fP" 10
Will be replaced by the long description of the package (when specified, see
the -descfile command line parameter) - or the summary otherwise.
 
.IP "\fB__DIR__\fP" 10
Gets replaced by a complete list of files from your source directory. This is
only useful if the given source already reflects the target file system (i.e.
a file which should be placed as "/etc/file.conf" must be in "etc/file.conf",
relativ to the packages root directory, and so on). If your source provides a
makefile with an install target, this is usually \fBNOT\fP the case, and you
must \fBNOT\fP use the __DIR__ variable.
 
.IP "\fB__GROUP__\fP" 10
Gets replaced by the $GROUP variable (or what you specified with the -g
command line parameter). See \fI/usr/share/doc/rpm/GROUPS\fR for available
group definitions.

If the \fB-section\fR parameter is specified (or the \fBSECTION\fR configuration
parameter is set), \fB__GROUP__\fR gets replaced by the given section name \fBfor
the Debian .dspec file only\fR, while the RPM .spec file still will use the group.
 
.IP "\fB__LICENSE__\fP" 10
Will be replaced with the $LICENSE (-l) - usually GPL :)
 
.IP "\fB__NAME__\fP" 10
This is the placeholder for the package name you specify as the first
parameter on the command line.

.IP "\fB__PACKAGER__\fP" 10
The $PACKAGER variable (or -p paramter value) goes here.
 
.IP "\fB__PROVIDES__\fP" 10
Using the -prov command line switch, you can pass a list of items your
package provides. These will be split and each provides will be placed on a
separate line, like

Provides: provides1
.br
Provides: provides2

If you did not pass the -prov parameter, the entire line will be removed.
 
.IP "\fB__RELEASE__\fP" 10
Will be replaced with the $RELEASE configuration variable, or what you
specified using the -r command line switch.
 
.IP "\fB__REQUIRES__\fP" 10
The opposite to __PROVIDES__ (see above for details). With -req you can manually
provide a list of dependencies. Note however, that rpmbuild as well as debbuild
are able to automatically determine those, if you did not enter the line

AutoReqProv: no

in your SPEC file (template). However, in some cases you may want to add to the
automatic dependencies, or just handle them yourself completely - so you can use
this replacement variable.

.IP "\fB__DEB_REQUIRES__\fP, \fB__RPM_REQUIRES__\fP" 10
With this tags you can define requirements specific to the Debian resp. RPM
packages. For example, if your package depends on PHP, but not on a specific
version or installation (e.g. Apache module or CGI can be used), the corresponding
lines in your Spec template could look like

__DEB_REQUIRES__: libapache2-mod-php5 | libapache-mod-php5 | php5-cgi | php5 | libapache2-mod-php4 | libapache-mod-php4 | php4 | php4-cgi
.br
__RPM_REQUIRES__: php

So the RPM would be build to simply require "php", while the Debian package
would require one of the alternatives from the __DEB_REQUIRES__ list. You are
still free to use the __REQUIRE__ tag (or the literal "Requires:") in your SPEC
template to define requirements common to both systems.

Only the term (__DEB_REQUIRES__ resp. __RPM_REQUIRES__) will be replaced by
"Requires" for the corresponding SPEC file. The respectively other line will
be removed, so the SPEC is kept syntactically correct.

.IP "\fB__SUMMARY__\fP" 10
A short summary for your package can (and should, if your template uses this
variable) be passed to pkgmake using the -s command line switch. This should
give a brief explanation of what your package is - and will go here.
 
.IP "\fB__VENDOR__\fP" 10
See __PACKAGER__ - but here it is the author of the code.
 
.IP "\fB__VENDORURL__\fP" 10
If $VENDORURL is set by your config, or you passed it with -u, this will go
here as

URL: <what://you.configured.or/passed>

Otherwise, the line will be removed.
 
.IP "\fB__VERSION__\fP" 10
This is to be replaced by the version - the second parameter you have to pass
to the pkgmake executable on the command line.
