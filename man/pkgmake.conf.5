.TH "PKGMAKE.CONF" "5" "19 July 2007"
.SH "NAME" 
pkgmake.conf \- Configuration file for \fBpkgmake\fR, which creates RPM spec
files and builds *.rpm/*.deb packages
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents the options that can be set in the pkgmake.conf
configuration file. For a description of what pkgmake does, see the pkgmake(8)
manpage.

.SH "SETTINGS" 
.PP 
The syntax of options is OPTION=value. The pkgmake.conf must be executable,
since it will be sourced into the pkgmake main script.

.PP
The following settings are available in pkgmake.conf: 

.IP "\fBBUILDDEB\fP" 10
Set this to the top directory of your build environment. For RPM, this is
usually /usr/src/rpm (or /usr/src/redhat on RedHat/CentOS). For the use of
debbuild, create a symlink /usr/src/debian pointing to /usr/src/rpm, or make
a copy of /usr/src/rpm as /usr/src/debian - debbuild is looking at that
location. Optionally enclose the directory name in quotes for the sake of
spaces in it.

.IP "\fBDEBBUILD\fP" 10 
Name of the debbuild executable, optionally with path. To build *.rpm files,
this would be "rpmbuild".

.IP "\fBVENDOR\fP" 10 
This is usually the author of the software. Use the syntax "John Doe <john@doe.com>",
i.e. "Name <email@address>" for this field - or rpmbuild will break.

.IP "\fBVENDORURL\fP" 10
The website of the author. Make sure to "escape" all slashes here, since the
string is used in a regular expression as-is. Example: "http:\\/\\/domain.com\\/"
 
.IP "\fBPACKAGER\fP" 10 
Who made the package. See VENDOR for syntax.

.IP "\fBBUILDARCH\fP" 10 
Target build architecture, e.g. i386, athlon, noarch

.IP "\fBLICENSE\fP" 10 
License of this software. Usually GPL
 
.IP "\fBRELEASE\fP" 10 
An optional release suffix. Shouldn't be a too long string.
 
.IP "\fBGROUP\fP" 10 
Software group for e.g. the menu. On Ubuntu, this usually starts with the
repository (e.g. "universe"). Again, escape all forward slashes. Examples
are: "universe\\/Graphic" (Ubuntu/Debian) or "Applications\\/Graphic" (RPM).

.IP "\fBSPECONLY\fP" 10
If set to "1", pkgmake will only create the .spec file and exit (see also
the -speconly command line parameter). Use this if you first want to check
the .spec file before entering the build process - e.g. when testing.

.IP "\fBMKTAR\fP" 10
Whether a source tarball (<program>-<version>.tar.gz) shall be created in
the SOURCES/ directory (MKTAR=1) or not (MKTAR=0). Use the -notar command
line switch to override (if your configuration says "MKTAR=1" and you
don't want this for this run). If specified, the -d switch will be ignored.

.IP "\fBNUKECVS\fP" 10
Shall we remove all CVS/* and .svn/* directories/files from the copy of the
sources? Usually, you will set this to "1" since you don't want to have them
in your distribution tarball. See also the -nonukecvs command line parameter.
